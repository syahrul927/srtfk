*A professional photography management platform that streamlines event organization, client photo delivery, and visual content search through AI-powered OCR.*

---

## Overview

PhotoIn solves the chaotic workflow of professional photography businesses by creating a centralized platform for organizing shoots, managing photos across Google Drive, and delivering searchable galleries to clients. The platform **eliminates 80% of administrative overhead** through automated Google Drive organization, AI-powered text extraction, and professional client portals. Designed for **wedding photographers, studio owners, and event photography businesses** who need to manage thousands of photos across multiple client projects while maintaining professional presentation standards.

## Key Features

- **Intelligent Google Drive Integration** â€” automatically creates structured folder hierarchies for each event and syncs photos without manual file management
- **AI-Powered Photo Search** â€” built unique OCR pipeline that extracts text from images and enables keyword-based photo discovery across entire photo libraries
