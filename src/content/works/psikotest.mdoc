# Psychological Testing Platform | Full-Stack Application

## Overview

A comprehensive web platform built for conducting and managing psychological assessments, serving both test administrators and participants through intuitive, mobile-responsive interfaces. This production-ready application supports three major psychological test types with real-time administration, automated scoring, and detailed result analysis.

## Technical Excellence

### Architecture & Stack

- **Next.js 15** with App Router and Server Components
- **TypeScript** for end-to-end type safety
- **tRPC** for type-safe API layer
- **PostgreSQL** with Prisma ORM for complex relational data
- **Real-time features** with React Query and optimistic updates
- **Zero-config deployment** supported with Docker-ready setup

### Advanced Features Implemented

- **Multi-tenant assessment system** supporting IST, Kraepelin, and Papi Kostick tests
- **Real-time session management** with automatic state persistence
- **Adaptive testing interfaces** optimized for mobile and desktop
- **Automated scoring algorithms** with age-based standardization
- **Role-based access control** (admin vs. participant)
- **Comprehensive test result visualization** with interactive charts

## Key Problems Solved

### 1. Scalable Test Administration

Implemented a queue-based system that allows administrators to send test invitations via unique URLs, eliminating manual test distribution while maintaining security.

### 2. Complex Data Relationships

Designed normalized database schema handling 20+ interconnected entities with polymorphic relationships between test types, results, and scoring tables.

### 3. Real-time User Experience

Built responsive interfaces that maintain test state across devices, ensuring users can pause/resume without data loss.

## Core Features

### Admin Dashboard

![Admin Dashboard](/images/admin-dashboard.png) **Test Management Dashboard**
Centralized control for creating, distributing, and monitoring psychological tests across different assessment types.

### Test Administration

![Test Intercface](/images/test-interface.png) **Mobile-Optimized Test Interface**
Participant-facing interface supporting timed tests with progress tracking, question randomization, and automatic submission.

### Results & Analytics

![Result Dashboard](/images/results-dashboard.png) **Comprehensive Results System**
Detailed analysis with standardized scoring, percentile calculations, and professional interpretations delivered for each test type.
